    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
   <p>I am a first-year student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad. </p> 

  <h1> Why should I be selected for this project?</h1> 
  <p>
    This is the first time I am submitting a proposal to any organization. I am new to the field of open-source coding, but this is something which has fascinated me. I am looking forward to contribute a lot towards open-source coding and build impressive projects. I am ready to build this project with great zeal under the guidance of my mentors.
  </p>  
  <h1>Post WOC Plans</h1>
  <p>I will continue exploring a lot more in the field of web development. I wish to work on more projects on individual as well as team level. I wish to create interactive websites in future.</p>
